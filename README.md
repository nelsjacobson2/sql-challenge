Employee Database - Data Modeling, Engineering, and Analysis
This project involved creating a data model to represent an employee database, engineering tables to import data, and using SQL to perform data analysis.

Data Modeling
We started by creating an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to represent the relationships between all of the tables in the employee database. We used pgAdmin4 to create the ERD and defined relationships between tables such as "one-to-many" and "many-to-many".

Data Engineering
After creating the ERD, we proceeded to create the necessary tables for the employee database to be imported. Using SQL code, we created tables for employees, departments, titles, salaries, and more. Once the tables were created, we imported data from various CSV files into the tables.

Data Analysis
After importing the data, we used SQL queries to analyze the data and find useful information about the employees. We ran queries such as listing employee numbers, last names, first names, sex, and salary for each employee. We also queried for the manager of each department, the department number for each employee, and the employee's department name. Additionally, we listed employee information based on certain conditions such as first name, last name, and sex. Lastly, we used SQL to count frequency of employee last names.

Overall, this project involved data modeling, engineering, and analysis of an employee database. Through this process, we were able to gain insights about employee data that could be useful for decision-making processes.
